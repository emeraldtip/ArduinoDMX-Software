# Arduino-DMX sofware

This is an absolutely horrible DMX console that is pretty much completely useless, slow and broken
Serial just isn't made to handle stuff like this
Data integrity is pretty bad (at least was for me)

Also the code is written in like 1-2 nights and is absolute dogshit

I tried to fix data integrity using bytes instead of strings (whcih was pretty stupid)
But data integrity still seems to be garbage and I can't figure out for the life of me how to get it working reliably
